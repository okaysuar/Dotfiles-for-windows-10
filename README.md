# 🪟 Windows Explorer Blur + Mica  
Turning File Explorer from “government office UI” into something that actually belongs on a modern computer.

This setup adds blur, mica, and general visual sauce to Windows.  
Your desktop will finally stop looking like Windows 7 woke up in the wrong decade.

---

## ⚙️ Installation  
Congrats, this one is insanely easy. Even Windows can’t mess it up.

1. Open the folder  
2. Double-click **register.cmd**  
3. Explorer will restart like it just rage-quit  
4. Boom, effects applied  
5. Customize whatever you want in the **config file**  
6. Flex your new aesthetic

If it didn’t work, Windows probably blocked it out of jealousy.

---

## 🖌️ Customization  
Everything visual lives in the config file.  
Open it, tweak values, break stuff, fix stuff, pretend you know what you’re doing.  
The blur and mica effects will adjust on the next Explorer reload.

---

## ❌ Uninstall  
Got bored? Laptop crying? Just want to pretend you're responsible?

1. Open the folder  
2. Double-click **uninstall.cmd**  
3. Explorer restarts  
4. Back to the default Windows beige-flavored UI

---

## ⭐ Enjoy  
Your File Explorer now has more personality than half the apps on your PC.
# 🖼️ Wallpapers  
A growing collection of wallpapers I use in my setup.  
They change often because my attention span does the same.

---

## 📥 Installation  
Super simple:

1. Open the folder  
2. Pick any wallpaper you like  
3. Right-click → **Set as desktop background**

That’s it. No tools, no configs, no mystic rituals.

---

## 🔁 Updates  
Wallpapers here will change whenever I switch my setup or get bored,  
so check back if you like new looks.

## 📌 Notes

Enjoy. Your monitor deserves some beauty too.
