# Dotfiles-for-windows-10
Its a reddish theme ill make more dotfiles of more themes in the future. Enjoy :)

# ✨ Custom Cursor Collection  
A curated set of cursed, classy, and dangerously smooth cursors.  
Because the default Windows cursor has been the same since dinosaurs used CRT monitors.

Level up your desktop aura. Become *that* person with the fancy pointer.  
Yes, it's unnecessary. Yes, it’s worth it.

---

## 🖱️ Installation  
Windows makes this way too easy:

1. Open the folder of the cursor you want  
2. Find the file named **install.inf**  
3. Right-click it  
4. Smash **Install**

Boom. Your cursor just evolved like a Pokémon.

---

## 📁 What’s Inside  
Each cursor folder includes:

- All the pointer icons you’ll ever need  
- The `.inf` file that installs everything for you  
- Enough style to make your desktop blush

---

## 💡 Notes  
- No software required  
- No third-party tools  
- Just right-click, install, flex  
- Switch cursors anytime if your vibe changes at 3AM

---

## 🎨 Credits  
If a cursor design isn’t mine, credit goes to the original creator.  
I just packaged them neatly so your setup can look premium without effort.

---

## ⭐ Enjoy your new precision-engineered pointing experience  
If your mouse feels faster after installing these, that’s just confidence kicking in.

# 🌌 Zen Browser Settings  
Because browsing the internet with default settings is like showing up to a party wearing school shoes.

This folder contains my Zen Browser configs, themes, and general wizardry.  
Use them if you want your browser to look and feel like it actually belongs in 2025.

---

## 🚀 Installation  
Zen does not have a “one-click import” because that would be *too convenient*.  
So here’s the ritual:

1. Open Zen  
2. In the address bar, type `about:support`  
3. Press Enter like you mean it  
4. Find the **Profile Folder** row  
5. Click **Open Folder**  
6. Replace the files inside with the ones from this repo (yes, overwrite them, you rebel)  
7. Restart Zen so it doesn’t have a breakdown

If Zen starts looking hotter than your GPA, you did it right.

---

## 📂 What’s Included  
- `prefs.js` — All the settings that took me hours to tweak  
- `chrome/` — The CSS magic responsible for the glow-up  
- Anything else needed to make Zen stop looking like Firefox’s cousin who still uses Facebook

---

## 📝 Notes  
- Don’t upload your **entire profile folder** unless you enjoy leaking weird browser caches  
- If Zen crashes, that’s on Zen. Not me.  
- If your Zen looks better after installing this, act surprised

---

## 🌟 Enjoy  
Welcome to a browser experience so clean it might raise your standards in life.


# 🪟 Windows Explorer Blur + Mica  
Turning File Explorer from “government office UI” into something that actually belongs on a modern computer.

This setup adds blur, mica, and general visual sauce to Windows.  
Your desktop will finally stop looking like Windows 7 woke up in the wrong decade.

---

## ⚙️ Installation  
Congrats, this one is insanely easy. Even Windows can’t mess it up.

1. Open the folder  
2. Double-click **register.cmd**  
3. Explorer will restart like it just rage-quit  
4. Boom, effects applied  
5. Customize whatever you want in the **config file**  
6. Flex your new aesthetic

If it didn’t work, Windows probably blocked it out of jealousy.

---

## 🖌️ Customization  
Everything visual lives in the config file.  
Open it, tweak values, break stuff, fix stuff, pretend you know what you’re doing.  
The blur and mica effects will adjust on the next Explorer reload.

---

## ❌ Uninstall  
Got bored? Laptop crying? Just want to pretend you're responsible?

1. Open the folder  
2. Double-click **uninstall.cmd**  
3. Explorer restarts  
4. Back to the default Windows beige-flavored UI

---

Your File Explorer now has more personality than half the apps on your PC.
# 🖼️ Wallpapers  
A growing collection of wallpapers I use in my setup.  
They change often because my attention span does the same.

---

## 📥 Installation  
Super simple:

1. Open the folder  
2. Pick any wallpaper you like  
3. Right-click → **Set as desktop background**

That’s it. No tools, no configs, no mystic rituals.

Enjoy. Your monitor deserves some beauty too.
