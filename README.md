# ✨ Custom Cursor Collection  
A curated set of cursed, classy, and dangerously smooth cursors.  
Because the default Windows cursor has been the same since dinosaurs used CRT monitors.

Level up your desktop aura. Become *that* person with the fancy pointer.  
Yes, it's unnecessary. Yes, it’s worth it.

## 🖱️ Installation  
Windows makes this way too easy:

1. Open the folder of the cursor you want  
2. Find the file named **install.inf**  
3. Right-click it  
4. Smash **Install**

Boom. Your cursor just evolved like a Pokémon.
